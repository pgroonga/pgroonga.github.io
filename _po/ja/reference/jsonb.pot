msgstr ""

msgid "PGroonga also supports `jsonb` type. You can search JSON data by one or more keys and/or one or more values with PGroonga."
msgstr ""

msgid "You can also search JSON data by full text search against all text values in JSON. It's an unique feature of PGroonga. Built-in PostgreSQL features and [JsQuery](https://github.com/postgrespro/jsquery) don't support it."

msgid "Think about the following JSON:"

msgid ""
"```json\n"
"{\n"
"  \"message\": \"Server is started.\",\n"
"  \"host\": \"www.example.com\",\n"
"  \"tags\": [\n"
"    \"web\",\n"
"  ]\n"
"}\n"
"```"

msgid "You can find the JSON by full text search with `server`, `example`, or `web` because all text values are full text search target."

msgid "## Operators"
msgstr ""

msgid "PGroonga provides the following two operators for searching against `jsonb`:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"  * [`@>` operator](operators/jsonb-contain.html)\n"
"  * [`@@` operator](operators/jsonb-query.html)"
msgstr ""

msgid "`@>` operator is simpler than `@@` operator but you can't use complex condition such as range search."
msgstr ""

msgid "`@@` operator is more complex than `@>` operator but you can use complex condition. You can also use full text search against all text values in JSON."

msgid "## Comparison with GIN"

msgid ""
"  * Index creation time: No difference\n"
"  * Search time: PGroonga is a bit faster\n"
