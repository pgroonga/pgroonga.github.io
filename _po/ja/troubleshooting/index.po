"Many PGroonga search issues stem from improper index setup. This "
"troubleshooting guide addresses these problems."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The following sections use a Q&A format to explain these issues in detail."
msgstr ""

msgid "## Q: I created a PGroonga index, but my searches are still slow."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"A: When a search is slow, it often means PostgreSQL is using a sequential "
"scan instead of the PGroonga index. To check this, run your query with "
"`EXPLAIN ANALYZE`."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If you see \"Seq Scan\" in the output, it indicates the system is not "
"utilizing the index. The goal is to see \"Index Scan using "
"pgrn_content_index\" or similar, indicating the index is being used."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Check the table configuration to confirm that PGroonga indexes are properly "
"set."

"<summary>To confirm whether a sequential search is being executed</summary>"
msgstr ""

msgid "We use a following table structure as an example."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"To ensure the search is definitely sequential in this example, no indexes or "
"primary keys have been set."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"```sql\n"
"CREATE TABLE memos (\n"
"  title text,\n"
"  content text\n"
");"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"INSERT INTO memos VALUES ('PostgreSQL', 'PostgreSQL is an RDBMS.');\n"
"INSERT INTO memos VALUES ('Groonga', 'Groonga is a super-fast full-text "
"search engine.');\n"
"INSERT INTO memos VALUES ('PGroonga', 'PGroonga is an extension that brings "
"super-fast full-text search to PostgreSQL.');\n"
"```"
msgstr ""

msgid "The query we are examining is as follows:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"```sql\n"
"SELECT * FROM memos WHERE content &@~ 'PostgreSQL';\n"
"```"
msgstr ""

msgid "Now, let's confirm whether the query is using a sequential search."
msgstr ""

msgid "As mentioned earlier, we'll use `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` to check."
msgstr ""

msgid "The result is as shown above."

msgid "In the case of a sequential search, \"Seq Scan\" will be displayed."
