msgstr ""

msgid "Our company, [Top Studio Corporation](https://www.topstudio.co.jp/), is a production company working mainly for the publisher's production like translation, writing, editing, proof reading, design, digital publishing, and etc."
msgstr ""

msgid "We are introducing our work in the [Web portfolio](https://www.topstudio.co.jp/books/). Yet, we did not have search system for our work portfolio on the Web site, even though we have been stocking our work with our PostgreSQL database."
msgstr ""

msgid "Because the sales departments requested to add the search function in order for the potential customer to search easily what kind of publishing the company has been done, we have examined \"how to develop the search system\". Of course, we had thought about simple SQL's LIKE operator and PostgreSQL's standard full text search feature, \"tequery\", but those methods require to clarify normalization of query strings and stored strings, or to install other big depending system like morphological analysis tool."
msgstr ""

msgid "On the other hand, PGroonga is very simple and easy to setup. It only requires to enable the extension after the install. Since our service system is based on Debian GNU/Linux to start, we only followed the direction on the [Debian GNU/Linux install guide][install-debian] to install."
msgstr ""

msgid "It is widely known to use multiple query words by using space between the words for narrowing-down the search results. We were thinking to use `&@~` operator in PGroonga for \"AND search\"."
msgstr ""

msgid "However, `&@~` operator requires highly functioned [query syntax][groonga-query-syntax] and the function is bit too much for general guest usage who only needs simple \"AND search\". We could imagine to receive nice advisories like \"your system has a SQL injection vulnerability\" that caused by too much high feature."
msgstr ""

msgid "Thus, we chose sadly not to use `&@~` operator. We split query to keywords with space and build a condition that combines the split keywords with `&@` operator that is for single keyword search and SQL's `AND`. The splitting rule for query is `/[\\s　,，.．・。、「」『』（）]+/` so that \"AND results\" come up even with random letters besides space."
msgstr ""

msgid "For the future, we would like to improve the system with our meta tag by using [the score feature of PGroonga][tutorial-score]. Our work data are labeled with meta tags that inform the contents of the book like \"Windows\", \"Linux\", \"Open Source\", \"machine learning\". Currently adding those meta tag as the search makes the search results hazy. But we think it is important to utilize those tags that our staff are working on."
